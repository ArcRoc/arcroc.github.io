	<h1>Want to vent or share an uplifting moment?
		<h2>This area was designed to offer guests a place to vent how they feel or share an inspirational moment. This may be public, private, shared with friends, or shared with people outside of your direct circle. Regardless of what you choose to share or with whom you choose to share it, we strongly encourage you to share the feelings you have rather than just a recital of events. Please include tags so users can find content that  relates to them more easily.
			<h3>What type of experience are you leaving today?
